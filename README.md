# Yunipal Islands Community Contributions Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the Yunipal Islands Community Contributions Repository! This repository is dedicated to two primary objectives:

1. **Eliminating Bugs**: Help us identify and fix existing bugs in the current and upcoming versions of Yunipal Islands.
2. **Gathering Feature Ideas**: Contribute innovative feature ideas that can enhance the onboarding experience for new users and make our game even more engaging.

We value and reward contributions to this repository with Yunipal Islands Governance tokens (YIG). Please note that YIG should not be considered a utility or investment token. Instead, it may be used for snapshot votes regarding future game development. However, we may also never use it. Below is our reward structure:

### Bug Reporting Rewards
- **Minor Bug**: 50 YIG  
  *Description: A minor issue that does not significantly impact gameplay or user experience but still needs to be addressed.*
  
- **Major Bug**: 100 YIG  
  *Description: A significant issue that affects gameplay or user experience and requires prompt attention.*
  
- **Critical Bug**: 250 YIG  
  *Description: A critical issue that severely impacts gameplay, user experience, or game stability, and requires immediate resolution.*

### Feature Idea Rewards
- **Groundbreaking Feature Idea**: 500 YIG  
  *Description: We are only interested in groundbreaking ideas that bring significant value to the onboarding experience or enhance the fun of battles. Ideas should go beyond the obvious and offer innovative approaches that contribute to long-term community engagement.*

### Disclaimer
Please be aware that we will determine the severity of bugs and whether a feature idea is groundbreaking. Contributions should be made with the intent to genuinely improve the game and community, not merely for the reward. The rewards are meant as a token of appreciation rather than an incentive. YIG will be distributed on the Base L2 network, and only if you provide a valid Ethereum address with your submission. Additionally, reward tokens will only be distributed if the corresponding address holds at least one Yunipal (no matter which chain).

## Feature Ideas: Additional Guidance

When submitting feature ideas, please consider the following:

- **Focus on Engagement**: The goal is to create features that facilitate the onboarding of new players into our community. We are not looking for generic suggestions, such as making the game available on mobile. Instead, we need ideas that encourage players to engage with our IP, fall in love with the monsters, and eventually, on their own journey, decide to become NFT collectors.
  
- **Innovative Thinking**: We seek ideas that are not just easy or obvious but offer innovative ways to draw in new users and retain their interest over time. Your ideas should help build a community that enjoys the game for its content, story, and characters, not just as a means to an end.

- **UX Consideration**: When proposing a feature idea, please also highlight how it could work from a UX (User Experience) perspective. Consider how the user would interact with the feature, and provide suggestions on how it could be implemented to enhance the overall experience.

- **Ease of Implementation**: Big feature ideas require significant time and resources. The simpler the idea, the better.

- **Implementation Disclaimer**: There is no guarantee that a feature idea will be implemented, even if it is considered a groundbreaking idea.
